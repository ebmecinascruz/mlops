# MLOps Class Project – Reproducible ML Pipelines

This repository is part of my **MLOps coursework** in the Master of Science in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco. The goal of the class is to learn how to build **reliable, reproducible, and production-ready** machine learning workflows.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop an end-to-end ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment
- Practice building modular code and workflows using MLOps tools
- Learn how to track data, parameters, and experiments
- Collaborate using Git and GitHub best practices

## 📦 Current Milestone

✅ **Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing + DVC Integration**  
- Clean and encode data
- Track raw and processed datasets with DVC
- Reproducible preprocessing script with `dvc.yaml`

Next steps:
- 🧠 Add model training stage
- 📊 Add evaluation + metrics logging
- 🚀 Set up model serving (Flask or FastAPI)
